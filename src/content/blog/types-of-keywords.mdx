## **Types of Keywords**

### **Short-tail keywords**

Short-tail keywords are simple, broad search terms usually consisting of one or two words, like "shoes" or "pizza". They are easy to remember and type, resulting in high search volumes and bringing significant traffic to websites. However, their popularity leads to high competition, making it challenging for websites to stand out. 

Short-tail keywords lack specificity, making it unclear what the searcher is looking for, which can result in less targeted traffic. Despite the challenges, short-tail keywords remain a crucial element of online search strategies. They provide a starting point for understanding general user interests.
