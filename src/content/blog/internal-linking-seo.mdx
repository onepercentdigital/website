Whether you're a seasoned SEO professional or a newcomer to the field, understanding the intricacies of internal linking can be a game-changer for your digital strategy.

Join us as we explore the foundations, best practices, and potential pitfalls of this essential SEO technique, and discover how to harness its power to elevate your website's search engine rankings and user engagement.

## **What Are Internal Links?**

Internal links are a crucial element of search engine optimization (SEO) that often goes underappreciated. These links are hyperlinks that connect one page to another within the same website. They serve multiple purposes, from improving site navigation to distributing page authority and enhancing the overall user experience.

### **Definition and purpose**

Internal links use relative URLs, which include only the page path without the full domain name. This distinguishes them from external links that point to pages on other websites.

The primary purpose of internal links is to create a logical structure for your website, making it easier for both users and search engines to navigate and understand the relationship between different pages.

### **Types of internal links**

#### 1\. **Navigational links**

Navigational links are the backbone of your website's structure. They are typically found in the main menu, header, footer, or sidebar of a page. Examples include links to "**Home**", "**About Us**", "**Products**", and "**Contact Us**".

Navigational links provide a consistent way for users to [access the main sections](https://www.brandeis.edu/cms-guide/best-practices/links-navigation.html) of your website from any page. They are crucial for creating a clear site hierarchy, which helps search engines understand the importance and relationship of different pages.

#### 2\. **Contextual links**

Contextual links are embedded within the body content of a page. They connect to other relevant pages or posts on your site, [providing additional value](https://backlinkmanager.io/blog/understanding-contextual-links-and-their-importance-in-seo/) to readers and helping search engines understand the relationships between different pieces of content. 

For instance, in a blog post about dog training, you might link the phrase "**positive reinforcement**" to another article explaining this concept in detail. These links are particularly powerful for SEO as they pass context and relevance along with link equity.

#### 3\. **Footer links**

Footer links are placed at the [bottom of web pages](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-footer) and often include important pages that don't fit in the main navigation. Common examples are "**Privacy Policy**", "**Terms of Service**", and "**Sitemap**". While they provide quick access to important information, footer links typically carry less SEO weight than links higher on the page.
