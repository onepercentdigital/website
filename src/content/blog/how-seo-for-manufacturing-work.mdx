### **Link building creates website authority**

Link building is obtaining links from other websites to your website. It is an essential part of SEO because search engines, like Google, use links to establish the authority and relevance of a website. 

The more high-quality links a website has pointing to, the higher its chances of ranking well in search engine results pages; it's simple as that!

For manufacturing companies, link-building can be challenging, but there are still effective ways to gain that reputation on Google and other search engines. 

The following are some ways in which SEO helps you connect to some renowned websites or platforms:

#### **Quality over quantity**

Creating high-quality, informative [content on your website](https://yoast.com/quality-content/) is one of the best ways to attract links from other websites. 

#### **Guest posting**

Identify reputable blogs and websites in your industry and offer to [write a guest post](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/guest-blogging-the-benefits-of-collaborative-content) for them. In exchange for your article, you can include a link to your website in your author bio or within the article.

#### **Supplier and partner links**

Contact your suppliers and partners and ask if they would be willing to link to your website from theirs. This is a great way to build relationships and generate valuable links beneficial for both sides. 

Remember, link building takes time and effort. It's important to focus on building high-quality links rather than trying to get as many links as possible. 

Also, avoid spammy link-building practices. That will harm your website's reputation and hurt your search engine rankings.

### **Post high-quality content as much as possible**

Even if you pick the best keywords and have the best [backlinking strategy](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/how-to-get-backlinks-to-your-website), if your content is not unique, informative, and engaging, your readers and potential customers will leave your website and not buy your product/service. 

This is a situation where you create trust issues with your potential customers because low-quality content will make your website look spammy and your brand unreliable. 

The bottom line is with high-quality content, SEO is a top-of-the-cherry pie; 

So, what makes a piece of content good? Usually, high-quality content has relevance, accuracy, clarity, and usefulness to the intended audience. 

You can post different types of content and still find a way to optimize it. That includes articles, blogs, whitepapers, visual content such as videos, infographics, images, or audio content such as podcasts.

#### **Publishing good content**

So, what is the secret to a good content? We've got you covered!

*   Before creating content, knowing who you're creating it for is important. [Determine your target audience](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/what-is-a-target-audience-and-how-to-define-yours-through-target-market-analysis) and what their interests are.
*   Identify the areas where your company has a unique perspective and focus on creating content that showcases this expertise.
*   Does your target audience prefer blogs, white papers, videos, or infographics? Choose the format that will best convey your message to your audience.
*   Keep up with the latest trends and technologies and create content that speaks to these changes.
*   Research your target audience's challenges and pain points and create content that provides solutions. 
*   Use relevant keywords in your content to help it rank higher in search engine results. 

### **Meta description, title tag & headings**

Make sure that your website is easy to navigate and has a clear structure. Use header tags (H1, H2, H3) to organize the content and make it easier for search engines and people to understand the hierarchy of your information.

About title tags, an informative and catchy title is always a good idea. You can use power words, adjectives, or brackets to make the title more interesting for the reader.

So, the [meta description](https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Meta_Description) is a short HTML tag that summarizes a web page's content. It appears in the search engine results pages (SERPs) under the page title as a text snippet describing what the page is about. 

**Pro tip:** Always use the main keywords in the meta description and the title.

Here is an example of a good meta description:
