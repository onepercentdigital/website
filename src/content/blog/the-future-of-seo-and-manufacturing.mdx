#### **Keyword research**

This time-consuming task can be made easier with AI technology. Not only will you find suitable keywords and phrases, but you can use them for analysis. With it, you can check the performance of your anchor texts, semantic keywords, and keyword variations. 

Remember that quality keyword research is essential for optimizing your site. So, [with the help of AI software](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/04/how-to-use-ai-keyword-research-tool-to-grow-your-blog), the future of SEO looks bright.

#### **Content creation**

Many [AI tools can craft delicate and quality content](https://aicontentfy.com/en/blog/top-ai-tools-to-take-content-to-next-level). Remember that Google uses natural language processing to see what’s on your page. Therefore, creating engaging content that matches the user’s intent will only benefit you. 

Whether it’s blog posts or images you seek, there are online tools that can create unique content. However, remember that “human touch” is still needed when it comes to writing. 

Even though the information in the article is credible, don't forget the audience. People usually react and engage better with humor and personal experience. So, instead of creating content only for search engines, make it suitable for your audience as well.

#### **Analysis options**

With the fast growth of AI, there are many analysis options for SEO. Since this software can interpret data with inhumane speed, you can benefit greatly from it. 

Some of the crucial parts of your business to track are:

*   **Growth:** [Tracking your growth and performance](https://influencermarketinghub.com/ai-market-intelligence-software/) is essential for any business. Even though there are many online tools available, they’re time-consuming and manual. With AI technology, this process can be simplified and automated. So, instead of repeating the same mistakes, you’ll be alarmed if any issues arise. 
*   **Competitors**: [Tracking your competitor’s performance](https://www.mentionlytics.com/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-can-optimize-competitors-monitoring/) is always valuable. Even though many manual online monitoring tools exist, they’re difficult and time-consuming. As AI grows, this process can also be automated so you can track any SEO changes the competitors make. Doing so guarantees you a top position in your industry’s market.
*   **Algorithm:** One of the biggest difficulties in SEO is keeping up with algorithm changes. Since updates often happen unexpectedly and fast, many companies rush to do a site audit. It's thought that AI will be able to track these changes effortlessly. With its help, you can make all the necessary changes quickly and without much haste. Thus, you’ll avoid the dreaded penalties and blacklisting. 

#### **Ranking**

Last but not least, AI will be able to help you with consistent ranking in the future. Remember that many actions go into this process. There’s both on-site and off-site SEO you should track. So, you won’t always know which action will bring you the best results.

### **Video as a dominant content form**

The next noticeable [change for the future is the use of video](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/how-to-boost-your-seo-ranking-with-video/). With recent updates in Google’s algorithm, this type of content is pushed as a dominant form. Even though written content offers valuable information for the reader, it’s more time-consuming. With video, the audience can quickly and effortlessly get what they came for.

Remember that people have a short attention span. Thus, the best way to catch and hold their attention is through short and interesting information. That’s why video has proven to be one of the most effective ways. 

Even though there are several ways to optimize your videos today, expect more in the future. Google has already announced its plans to experiment with short-form video content. So, you should look into the matter if you want to stay on top of the game.

### **Adapting to voice search**

Another newer technology that’s quickly gaining popularity is voice search. In the past, most people searched through a static desktop device. In today’s age, the use of computers has been replaced with mobile phones. Remember that everyone carries these devices on them and is glued to their screen for most of the day.

Instead of wasting time researching, people can get an instant answer with only one search. This process has become even faster with the use of voice search. Most phones come with built-in voice assistants, while there are also smart speakers.

In the future, you should prepare to match the requirements of this technology. Some key steps to focus on are the following:

*   [Using long-tail keywords](https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords) and full questions
*   Having an FAQ section
*   Using appropriate translations and conversational language
*   [Mobile-friendliness](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Best-practices-to-make-a-mobile-friendly-website)
*   [Fast loading speed](https://www.semrush.com/blog/page-speed/).

### **Authority and trustworthiness**

Even though your credibility [plays an important role](https://onepercentseo.com/importance-of-seo-for-manufacturing-businesses/) in today’s SEO, expect the same requirements for the future. It’s only natural that people will want to visit your website if it sounds legit. But if you lack credibility, you will most likely be seen as spam and avoided.

There are several measures you can take to ensure your business seems trustworthy. Some of them are:

*   **Website design:** The first thing a [user notices is your website’s design](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/seo-web-design). Don’t clutter ads everywhere, and provide a friendly user experience. Ensure a consistent theme is present and that your information is organized. Most users will decide if they trust the site or not with just a glance. 
*   **Linking to credible sources:** When creating content, always provide trustworthy information. Make sure you [link back to credible sources](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/235/no-website-is-an-island-why-and-how-to-link-to-others.aspx) and renowned sites. Additionally, double-check if the included information is up-to-date.
*   **Availability and user support:** The users should be your top priority. Always provide them with the needed support for a flawless experience. Ensure that the website meets their needs and that they feel proud to share it with friends.
