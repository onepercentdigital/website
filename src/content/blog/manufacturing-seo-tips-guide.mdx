### **Local vs. national SEO**

The [**local SEO approach**](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/what-is-local-seo-and-why-your-business-should-care) aims to attract an audience from a specific location. This can benefit manufacturing businesses that rely on local customers to drive revenue. Some key tactics for **local SEO** include:

*   Creating a Google My Business listing.
*   Building local citations and backlinks.
*   Local keyword and phrase optimization.
*   Encouraging customer reviews.

On the other hand, [**national SEO focuses**](https://bubblidigital.com/services/national-seo/) on reaching a broader audience nationwide. This can benefit businesses that sell products or services online or have multiple locations nationwide. Some key tactics for **national SEO** include:

*   Creating high-quality content.
*   Building high-quality backlinks.

## **7 Most Useful SEO Tips for Manufacturing**

### **Find the right keywords**

When people search for information online, they typically use specific words or phrases (known as keywords) to find what they're looking for.

Optimizing a website's content with relevant, [high-ranking keywords](https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/manufacturing-keywords/) makes it more likely to appear near the top of search engine results pages when people search for those keywords.

However, it's important to note that keyword usage should be balanced and strategic. Overusing or "stuffing" keywords into content can be viewed as spam by search engines, resulting in penalties or lower rankings.

Hence, it's essential to conduct thorough keyword research and use them naturally and in moderation throughout a website's content.

#### **Additional tips**

*   [Long-tail keywords](https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords) are more specific phrases that contain more words. They are usually less competitive and can attract more targeted traffic.
*   Consider the intent of the user when selecting keywords. For example, if someone is searching for "Best pasta in town," they're probably looking to order pasta, not to read a recipe.
*   Many keyword research tools, like Google Keyword Planner, [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), and SEMrush, will help you find the best keywords to target.
*   Use keywords in your website's content, but don't overdo it. Ensure your content flows naturally and is easy to read. Also, make sure your content flows naturally and is readable.
*   See what keywords your competitors target, and try incorporating some of those into your content.

### **Create a sitemap**

A [sitemap is a file that lists all the pages, videos, and other types of content](https://www.nectafy.com/blog/how-to-make-a-sitemap) on your website. It provides a roadmap to the website's structure, making it easier for search engine bots to find and index all the relevant pages. 

Furthermore, you can find two types of sitemaps, such as XML sitemaps and HTML sitemaps. 

[**XML sitemaps**](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) are designed for search engines and include information such as when the page was last updated the importance of the page, and the frequency of changes. Some of the benefits of XML sitemaps are:

*   Faster page indexation.
*   Better website crawlability.
*   Avoid content duplication.

[**HTML sitemaps**](https://www.semrush.com/blog/html-sitemap/) are designed for users and provide an overview of the site's structure. Some benefits of HTML sitemaps are:

*   Better website navigation.
*   Opportunities for internal linking.
*   Better crawling start point.

### **Add metadata to your content**

Metadata in SEO refers to the information that provides context about a web page to search engines. In a manufacturing business, adding this simple step to your SEO strategy can help you rank higher and cause more traffic to your page. 

There are three main types of metadata important for SEO:

*   [**Title tag**](https://www.webfx.com/blog/seo/title-tag/)**:** The text that appears at the top of the browser window and on the search engine results page. The purpose of the title tag is to describe the page's content and include the target keyword.
*   [**Meta description**](https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Meta_Description?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=wiki_en&utm_term=%7Bmeta%20description%7D&utm_content=lp_meta_description&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsIejBhDOARIsANYqkD23nv2Is8IKImAr8SFjUTFhawkiajGrBEGduvoU5XW1VN8GeOIV6UQaAgwmEALw_wcB)**:** A summary of the page's content in the SERP. It should be engaging and include the target keyword.
*   **Meta keywords:** Used to describe the page's content. However, most search engines no longer use this type of metadata.

![Title Tag and Meta description](https://onepercentseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Title-Tag-and-Meta-description.png "Title Tag and Meta description")

If you don't know where to start, these are some of the basic steps to follow if you want to include metadata in your content:

#### **Metadata to your HTML**

[Add metadata to your HTML](https://mailchimp.com/resources/meta-tags-and-the-head-section-of-a-website) using the appropriate meta tags. For example, use the <title> tag for the title of your content and the **<meta name= "description">** tag for a summary.

#### **Alt text for images**

[Add alt text to your images](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/what-is-alt-text) that describe what they depict. This can help with accessibility and also provides additional information for search engines.

#### **Include social media metadata**

Open Graph tags and [Twitter Cards](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-cards/) can display your content properly on social media platforms.

#### **Review and test**

Have insight into your metadata performance to ensure it is accurate and complete. You can test your metadata using tools like [Google's Structured Data Testing Tool](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data) to ensure it is properly formatted.

### **Track your progress with Google Analytics**

Tracking your progress is important in every job, especially in manufacturing businesses. In the SEO world, this operation is [usually done with Google Analytics](https://www.wamda.com/2013/07/how-to-track-your-website-s-progress-on-google-analytics).

Using the data collected from Google Analytics, website owners can:

*   Improve the user experience on their website.
*   Identify which marketing campaigns are generating the most traffic and conversions.
*   Understand which pages and content on their website are performing well and which need improvement.

### **Set up a Google My Business Account**

[Google My Business](https://www.google.com/business/) is a free tool businesses and companies use to manage their online presence on Google's search engine, maps, and other platforms.

With this tool, you can create a profile for your manufacturing business and display it on Google along with your contact information, location, hours of operation, website, and other relevant details that users may search for.

Your customers can leave reviews, and you can respond to these comments, allowing you to engage with the customers and improve your online reputation.

Additionally, GMB provides useful insights and analytics about your listing, such as how many times your listing appeared in search results, how many clicks it received, and how many calls and directions requests were made. This data can help you understand how well your listing performs and make adjustments as needed.

### **Technical SEO**

[Technical SEO](https://yoast.com/what-is-technical-seo/) is particularly important for manufacturing businesses because it can help them reach potential customers by improving their website performance and UX.

Here are some of the key reasons why technical SEO is important for manufacturing businesses:

These optimizations can improve your website's overall performance, making it more user-friendly and easier to navigate.
