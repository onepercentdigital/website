## **Difference Between On-Site and Off-Site SEO**

Before you start planning out your SEO strategy, you must know the two main types. Remember that the optimization process doesn’t only happen on your website. That’s why you should focus on both on-site and off-site SEO.

First, [on-site SEO focuses](https://www.webfx.com/seo/learn/onsite-seo/) on all the changes you’re doing directly on your website. This requires coding knowledge and attention to detail. Since search engines will review your site's quality, everything has to be in perfect order. 

The most crucial elements of on-site SEO include the following:

*   Keywords
*   Metadata
*   Alt text
*   Title tags
*   URLs
*   Headings
*   Loading time

[Off-site SEO focuses](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/off-page-seo-checklist) on all the actions happening outside the boundaries of your website. One of its main purposes is to raise domain authority by linking back to relevant pages. This can be social media posts, various platforms, or renowned sites. You can also create content that will interest other credible sites to publish you.

Both on-site and off-site SEO practices are important for your business. You should never focus only on one of them because it can backfire. Instead, try crafting a strategy that features both of them for the best results.

## **SEO Strategies and Tactics for Manufacturers**

Every good strategy starts with thorough research and planning, especially when it comes to a complex process such as SEO. 

Remember that these strategies are long-lasting when done right. Even though you won’t see the results immediately, you’ll gradually make progress within a year.

Just as with any marketing opportunity, there are several SEO strategies [manufacturers can benefit from](https://onepercentseo.com/seo-benefits-for-manufacturing-companies/). You may not know where to begin if you haven’t optimized your website before. 

So, here are the best tactics that can help start your SEO strategy:

*   Keyword research
*   Including metadata
*   Creating a sitemap
*   Regular posting of quality content
*   Link building
*   Analyzing your performance

### **Keyword research**

The first step during your optimization process should be discovering suitable keywords. During your research, you should focus on what the users are searching for. This is also known as user intent. In simple terms, you're putting yourself in the customer’s shoes. By doing so, you start to understand what made them buy the product.

During your keyword research process, you should target industry-specific phrases. Additionally, you can experiment with long-tail or question keywords. Just make sure that they have a high search value and low difficulty.

Remember that it’s better to focus on their quality instead of quantity. Long-tail keywords are bigger phrases searched less often but can point to your unique product. This way, you’ll target an audience that will more likely become customers.

If you need online tools to help you out during your keyword research, check out:

*   [Google Keyword Planner](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243?hl=en)
*   [Ahrefs Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer)
*   [Moz Keyword Explorer](https://moz.com/explorer)
*   [Semrush Keyword Research](https://www.semrush.com/features/keyword-research-toolkit/)

These online tools will help track all the needed metrics during your research. You should focus on the volume, relevance, and competition. This will determine how many people search for the specific word or phrase. Therefore, you'll discover if there are any recent trends and the keyword's difficulty.

### **Including metadata**

Your next strategy should be to include metadata wherever possible. This is a crucial step for search engines to understand what’s on your website. Furthermore, it should be applied to each of your pages, including landing pages and blogs.

The two main types of metadata are descriptive and structural. The first focuses on the basic information, such as what it is and what it contains. Structural metadata shows where the information fits the larger scale. This can include its broader topic and how it relates to other data.

During this strategy, the key elements are:

*   Title tags
*   Meta descriptions
*   Image tags
*   Alt text

#### **Title tags**

Title tags, also known as meta titles, describe the topic of your website. They’re the first element a search engine notices and should contain a keyword. If you’ve hired an expert, they can add them through the HTML code. But most website platforms provide a specific section where you can include them without coding knowledge.

Remember that meta titles are most effective within a 60-character length. They should be attention-grabbing and creative because they appear on the SERP.

#### **Meta descriptions**

Right below the meta title, you can notice the meta description. It summarizes the page’s context within two sentences. 

When [writing meta descriptions](https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Meta_Description), ensure they’re within 150 and 160 characters. They should also be catchy and contain the keyword to grab the user’s attention. 

Even though meta descriptions don’t directly affect SEO, they’re useful for driving traffic. 

#### **Image tags and alt text**

Image tags [provide additional information](https://yoast.com/image-seo-alt-tag-and-title-tag-optimization/) to search engines about the media. Even though it doesn’t directly affect the SEO, it ensures the image loads correctly.

On the other hand, the alt text gives a detailed description of the picture. You can also include a keyword because search engines scan them for more information. This will improve your chances of appearing in the image search results.

### **Creating a sitemap**

The next tactic in your SEO strategy should be [creating or registering a sitemap](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/how-to-create-a-sitemap-and-why-you-should). This file will provide detailed information about all the content on your website and how it interlinks. It should include all your pages, multimedia, and important data.

Its main goal is to ease the process for search engines when analyzing your website. Remember that crawlers will go through the whole site themselves if you don't guide them. Having a sitemap will work as a manual. It'll give them all the necessary information and help them analyze it better. 

Furthermore, with a sitemap, you can exclude unnecessary pages. Crawling is one of the main steps to ranking, so include only your relevant and trustworthy pages. 

Remember that Google ranks your website based on those criteria. It will help you reach the top results faster and without an issue.

### **Regular posting of quality content**

Once you’ve regulated the technical aspects, you should focus on creating relevant content. You don’t want your website to be dull and inactive. Always try to keep it fresh and up-to-date. Thus, update it regularly by posting content frequently. If you don’t have the time to post often, try to do it at least on a monthly basis.

Remember that the content you’re producing should satisfy the user’s intent. So, look up recent trends and analyze what drives your audience the most. Closely inspect if they have any questions about your products and give them an answer. By tailoring your content to the needs of the audience, you’ll start to gain credibility and trust.

However, this is also based on the information you post. Always fact-check your sources and ensure they’re up-to-date. 

Furthermore, watch out for any grammar mistakes, and don’t indulge in keyword stuffing. You want your content to please both the reader and the search engines.

### **Link building**

The next step you should focus on is [proper link building](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/link-building-101). It’s one of the most important aspects to rank higher on Google. This means the better quality backlinks you have, the higher you can rank. Additionally, linking to popular websites affects your authority and trustworthiness.

Always keep the placement and anchor text in mind when crafting your link-building strategy. Google has a whole policy when placing links, so try to include them in the main body of the website. 

Furthermore, the higher they are on the page, the more authority they have. Hence, avoid placing important links in the sidebars and footers.

The anchor text describes what page you’re linking to. It’s beneficial both for search engines and the readers. Try to make this text as relevant and descriptive as possible for better results.
