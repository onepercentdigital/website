## **Best Practices for Guest Posting**

### **Blog guidelines**

The first step in writing a fantastic guest post is following the [host blog's guidelines](https://problogger.com/how-to-host-guest-blogs-while-building-your-credibility/).  You should begin by diving into their guidelines because every blog has its own unique flavor. 

Take note of the post length they're after and the style that suits their audience. It's important to try to match the vibe of their existing content – this shows respect for their platform.

Before submitting, you need to give your post a final polish. Make sure to catch any typos, smooth out grammar issues, and check off all the requirements they've set. Follow the blog's submission process carefully; some prefer a quick pitch, while others want the full post immediately.

### **Adding value**

When you write a guest post, aim to bring **something fresh and original** instead of rehashing what others have already said. Share your unique perspectives and personal experiences to captivate your readers. It's crucial to support your points with thorough research using credible sources to enhance the credibility of your post.

You should consider the challenges your readers might be facing and provide practical solutions in your writing. It is invaluable to offer actionable advice that readers can apply in their own lives. You can use real-life examples to illustrate how your suggestions can be implemented effectively, making your post both informative and engaging.

### **Building relationships**

Before you write a post, take the time to get to know the blog. You should leave comments on their articles and share their posts on social media; this shows you care about their work.

When your post is published, help promote it by **sharing it on your own social media**. This brings more people to their blog, and they'll appreciate your support.

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid in Guest Posting**

### **Over-promotion**

Writing a guest post makes it easy to get carried away talking about yourself. But this is a big mistake. Readers don't want to see a post that's all about you or your products. 

Instead, focus on giving them useful information. Share helpful tips and ideas. Use your experience to teach, not to brag. This way, readers will trust you more.

Be careful with links, too. Don't fill your post with links to your own website, as this can make your post look spammy. Use links only when they really [help the reader](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context). 

Most of your links should be to other helpful resources, not just your site. In your author bio, keep things short and simple.

### **Ignoring the host blog's audience**

Another common mistake is not knowing your audience. Every blog has a unique group of readers with specific interests and needs. Take the time to understand these readers before you start writing. 

You should look at popular posts on the blog to see which topics get the most comments. This will help you write content that resonates with them.

Furthermore, pay attention to the blog's usual tone. Some blogs are serious, while others are fun and casual; try to match this style in your writing. Also, choose a topic that fits the blog and interests its readers. If you're unsure what to write about, ask the blog owner for ideas.

### **Neglecting follow-up**

When your post is published, your job isn't finished. Many writers disappear after publishing, but there's more to do. 

You might receive comments on your post, so be sure to respond. Answer questions and thank people for their feedback. This shows you care about your readers.

Don't forget to share your post on social media. Post about it and tell your friends; this helps bring more readers to the blog. The blog owner will appreciate this extra effort.

After everything is done, stay in touch with the blog owner. Thank them for the opportunity, and keep the communication open.
